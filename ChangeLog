afl-cov-0.3 (06//2015):
    - Add fuzzing-dir/cov/afl_cov_status file to track the current PID, argv,
      and afl-cov version.

afl-cov-0.2 (05/28/2015):
    - Add the fuzzing-dir/cov/id-delta-cov file which lists all functions and
      (and optionally lines) that are executed by the first "id:000000*" test
      case, and then lists all new functions/lines executed in subsequent test
      cases. In --func-search or --line-search modes, the id-delta-cov file is
      parsed directly instead of parsing cov/diff/ file output. Here is an
      example of what the contents of this file looks like:

      # id:NNNNNN*_file, cycle, src_file, coverage_type, fcn/line
      id:000000,orig:access.conf, 0, proj/log_msg.c, function, free_logging()
      id:000000,orig:access.conf, 0, proj/log_msg.c, function, init_logging()
      id:000000,orig:access.conf, 0, proj/log_msg.c, function, log_msg()

    - Replace the fuzzing-dir/cov/zero-cov/ directory with a single file
      at the same path fuzzing-dir/cov/zero-cov that lists all
      functions/lines that are never executed by any AFL test case.
    - Add the fuzzing-dir/cov/pos-cov file that lists all functions/lines
      that are executed at least once by an AFL test case.
    - Use the 'fuzzer_stats' file for acquiring the afl-fuzz PID in --live
      mode. This closes issue #4 on github.
    - Default to not preserving all lcov files - just keep the final one that
      contains all cumulative coverage results. This behavior can be changed
      with the --preserve-all-lcov-files argument.
    - Track and display the AFL cycle number for each queue/id:NNNNNN* file.

afl-cov-0.1 (05/09/2015):
    - Initial release
