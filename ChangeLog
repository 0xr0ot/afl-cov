afl-cov-0.2 (05//2015):
    - Replace the fuzzing-dir/cov/zero-cov/ directory with a single file
      at the same path fuzzing-dir/cov/zero-cov that lists all
      functions/lines that are never executed by any AFL test case.
    - Add the fuzzing-dir/cov/pos-cov file that lists all functions/lines
      that are executed at least once by an AFL test case.
    - Use the 'fuzzer_stats' file for acquiring the afl-fuzz PID in --live
      mode. This closes issue #4 on github.
    - Default to not preserving all lcov files - just keep the final one that
      contains all cumulative coverage results. This behavior can be changed
      with the --preserve-all-lcov-files argument.
    - In --func-search or --line-search mode, if an existing
      fuzzing-dir/cov/diff/ directory exists then parse the diff files
      directly for function/line matches.
    - Track and display the AFL cycle number for each queue/id:NNNNNN* file.

afl-cov-0.1 (05/09/2015):
    - Initial release
